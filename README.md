# Data211-Project
This is a Project for the course Data 211 Data Visualization with Professor Iresha Premarathna.

For this project, we were tasked with the following instructions:

You will be collecting data about your daily life on one topic (e.g., amount of sleep, amount of coffee
consumption, etc.) of your own choice over a two-week period. Come up with a question that you can
answer using your data (e.g., Is your average amount of sleep less than the recommended 8 hours by the
National Sleep Foundation)? Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses to answer your question.
Generate appropriate graphs to show your data (at least one graph) and explain your findings. Perform a
T-test, a Z-test, or a simple linear regression to answer your question.

My project will be detailing the relationship between screen time before you sleep and your sleep quality/energy level 
in the following morning. The data I have collected is from myself over a period of about 2 weeks.
